# Variance partitioning coefficient for a 2-level empty negative binomial model

This repository contains a custom function to calculate the VPC for a 2-level unconditional (empty)
negative binomial model.

This is meant to be used with the results of an unconditional (empty) 2-level negative binomial model.

A 2-level negative binomial arises when the outcome of interest is a count variable with overdispersion and observations are nested in hierarchical units.

A typical example of such a setting would be the number of days in which pupils are absent from school. Overdispersion refers to the situation when the variance of a count variable is larger than its mean, so it does not conform to the underlying assumption of a Poisson distribution. Underdispersion is also possible, but overdispersion is far more common.

The function *vpc_neg_binom* can use a "glmerMod" object or you can input the parameters directly.

You can download the function and call it in R by typing: **source("vpc_neg_binom.R")**

The function uses the following parameters:

**x** is a "glmerMod" object

**beta** is the intercept (in the log-scale)

**u** is the level-2 variance

**alpha** is the overdispersion parameter (reciprocal of theta, which is what the "glmerMod" object reports)

The formula implemented is the one described in Leckie et al. (2020) [1] (**equation 16**).

This repository also contains the code for a shinyapp to calculate the VPC by inputting
the parameter values directly.
